# Windows-Idler

To keep away low-threat individuals (e.g. kids) from messing around your computer, it is best to lock your computer.
However, there are times when you want to leave some processes working in the background, thus you may want a way to lock your computer while preventing your computer from putting into sleep. This PowerShell script provides a way for you to let your computer idle and process whatever you want in the background.

You can use Idler when you are:
* running backups
* running antimalware software
* running to restroom in the middle of playing games
* playing music in the background
* downloading files
* etc.
